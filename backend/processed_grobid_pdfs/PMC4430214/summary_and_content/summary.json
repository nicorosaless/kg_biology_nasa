    "summary": "This study investigates the impact of spaceflight on mouse splenocyte function, focusing on changes in surface markers, antigen presentation, and cytokine production. Reports of recurring infections during and post-spaceflight suggest immune suppression linked to mission parameters. Prior research indicates alterations in leukocyte populations and immune activity following spaceflight, but inconsistencies exist due to mission-specific variables and individual health status. This research aims to provide a broader analysis of immune changes post-spaceflight, addressing how these changes may affect crew health during extended space missions.",

      "summary": "Flow cytometric analysis revealed distinct splenocyte cell populations between flight mice and ground controls immediately post-flight. Flight mice showed a unique third cell population (G3) with higher forward scatter (FS), indicating larger size, and increased CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and MHC I surface expression compared to ground controls (Fig 1a, 1b, 1c). After 24 hours of in vitro culture, ground control splenocytes exhibited increased cell density in G3 compared to flight mice splenocytes (Fig 2a).",

      "summary": "Detailed examination of surface marker changes on splenocytes from flight and ground control mice revealed significant differences in T-cell activation and dendritic cell antigen presentation. Flight mice splenocytes showed decreased CD4 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and increased CD8 MFI, along with reduced CD25 expression intensity in both CD4 and CD8 cells (Table 1). A significant increase in the CD11c+ dendritic cell population was observed in flight mice compared to ground controls.",

      "summary": "Post-stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and Concanavalin A (ConA), the total CD4+ cell population was significantly decreased in flight mice splenocytes across all culture conditions compared to ground controls (Fig 4a). ConA stimulation dramatically increased the CD4+CD25+ population, with a significant decrease observed in flight mice splenocytes (Fig 4c). CD8+ splenocytes developed two distinct populations, CD8lo+ and CD8hi+, after 24 hours in cell media, but the CD8hi+ expression diminished after ConA stimulation (Fig 5).",

      "summary": "Stimulation with TLR agonists revealed that MHC I expression from flight mice or ground controls demonstrated two distinct populations: MHC I lo (G3) and MHC I hi (G2) (Fig 7a). A global decrease of MHC I MFI was observed in flight mice splenocytes in the G2 (MHC I hi) population, while an increase was seen in the G3 (MHC I lo) population (Fig 7b). CD11c expression, a dendritic cell marker, showed a global decrease in splenocytes from flight mice.",

TLR-2 and TLR-4 agonists stimulated increased TNF-α and IL-6 production in flight mice splenocytes, with a significant difference noted in TNF-α induced by the TLR-2 agonist. (Tables 3 and 4).",

  "conclusion": "This study demonstrates that spaceflight conditions alter the activation properties and surface molecule expression of mouse splenocytes, potentially contributing to immune dysfunction observed post-spaceflight. The observed changes in dendritic cell and T-cell responsiveness, along with altered cytokine production, highlight the need for further investigation into the long-term effects of space travel on immune function. Understanding these changes is crucial for mitigating immune-related health risks during extended space missions.",

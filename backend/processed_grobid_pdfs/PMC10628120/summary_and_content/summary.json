It focuses on characterizing novel microbes isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) to expand genomic databases of space-relevant microbes, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential health threats. Six Gram-stain-positive bacterial strains were isolated from ISS surfaces, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to explore their phylogenetic affiliation, identifying them as novel species based on gyrB gene similarities, average nucleotide identity (ANI), and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values.",

  "conclusion": "The study successfully isolated and characterized five novel bacterial species from the ISS, enhancing the understanding of the ISS microbiome. These species exhibit unique genomic and phenotypic traits, including resistance to antibiotics and the potential for producing secondary metabolites. The rarity of these species in ISS metagenomes suggests they are not dominant members of the habitat. The research contributes to managing and potentially repurposing space habitat microbiomes for various applications, crucial for long-term space habitation.",

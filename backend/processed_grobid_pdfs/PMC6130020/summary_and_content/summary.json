    "summary": "This study investigates the roles of Arabidopsis annexins ANN1 and ANN2 in sugar transport and root development. The authors demonstrate that ANN1 and ANN2 are crucial for post-phloem sugar transport to the root tip, which indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. The research expands the understanding of annexin function in plants, revealing their importance in sugar allocation and stress response.",

This inhibition is rescued by exogenous sucrose, glucose, or fructose, but not by mannitol, sorbitol, or o-methyl-glucose, indicating a specific sugar-related effect rather than an osmotic one. Figure 1 shows the primary root growth of the mutants with and without sugar, demonstrating the rescue effect of sucrose.

The diffusion of CF in root tips is restricted in the mutants, while ANN1-overexpressing lines show enhanced diffusion.

  "conclusion": "ANN1 and ANN2 play a critical role in post-phloem sugar transport to root tips, influencing primary root growth, root cap development, and photosynthetic rates. The knockout mutants show impaired sugar diffusion in the root apex, leading to sugar starvation in the root tips and subsequent up-regulation of photosynthesis. The increased ROS and callose accumulation further restricts sugar transport, contributing to the observed phenotypes. These findings highlight the importance of annexins in regulating sugar allocation and stress responses in plants.",

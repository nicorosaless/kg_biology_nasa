    "text": "Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins that play important roles in plant cell signaling.Annexins are multifunctional proteins, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood.Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in seedlings.Here, we showed that ann-mutant seedlings grown in the absence of sugar show decreased primary root growth and altered columella cells in root caps; however, these mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru.In seedlings grown without sugar, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation was found in ann-mutant cotyledons compared to that in wild type, which indicates potential sugar starvation in the roots of ann-mutant seedlings.Unexpectedly, the overall sugar content of ann-mutant primary roots was significantly higher than that of wild-type roots when grown without sugar.To examine the diffusion of sugar along the entire root to the root tip, we examined the unloading pattern of carboxyfluorescein dye and found that post-phloem sugar transport was impaired in ann-mutant root tips compared to that in wild type.Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the root tips of ann-mutant seedlings grown without Suc, the latter of which would restrict plasmodesmal sugar transport to root tips.Our results indicate that ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem sugar transport to the root tip, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons.This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants.",

    "text": "Annexins are multifunctional proteins that have been found in all plants and vertebrate species.Their tertiary structure with calcium-binding domains is evolutionarily conserved in all species (Morgan et al., 2004(Morgan et al., , 2006;;Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2011;Clark et al., 2012).In plants, annexins have been localized in many parts of the cell, including the plasma membrane, the Golgi apparatus, secretory vesicles, vacuolar membranes, and the nucleus.Certain annexins are also found in the extracellular matrix as secreted proteins.\nOn the molecular level, certain plant annexins serve as components of calcium channels or regulate calcium channel activity to help initiate and amplify calcium signals in plants (Laohavisit et al., 2010;Laohavisit and Davies, 2011;Davies, 2014).On the cellular level, one of the earliest functions discovered for annexins in plant cells was meditation of vesicle trafficking and secretion (Konopka-Postupolska and Clark, 2017).On the whole-plant level, key discoveries of annexin function have been carried out using mutants of the model plant, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), where there are eight different annexins that show differential expression patterns (Cantero et al., 2006).Several of these mutant studies show that certain Arabidopsis annexins function to provide stress tolerance in response to a variety of stress conditions (Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2009;Dalal et al., 2014;Richards et al., 2014;Wang et al., 2015;Liao et al., 2017).For example, overexpression of ANN1 in Arabidopsis results in increased antioxidant activity and confers drought tolerance (Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2009).\nPlant annexins are expressed in all stages of plant growth and development.Recently, Thieme et al. (2015) found that some Arabidopsis annexin transcripts can be transported across the whole plant by phloem sap.Annexin proteins have also been identified in the phloem sap of several different plant species (Kehr, 2006), and in Arabidopsis, ANN1 was found in phloem exudate of rosette leaves (Guelette et al., 2012).Immunolocalization of a pea annexin protein in young developing sieve elements led to the suggestion that annexins may play a role in phloem cell development (Clark et al., 1992).In situ transcript localization studies found that ANN1 is expressed in phloem and phloem parenchyma in Arabidopsis seedlings (Clark et al., 2001).However, the physiological importance of annexins in phloem remains undefined.\nPhloem transport links sources to sinks and is a key passageway for communication between leaves and roots.Sugars generated from photosynthetic leaves (source organs) and transported through the phloem to roots (sink organs) serve both as metabolic substrates to fuel plant growth and development and as signals that integrate plant responses to environmental stimuli, hormones, and changes in nutrition status (Martin et al., 2002;Moore et al., 2003;Smeekens et al., 2010;Lastdrager et al., 2014;Ljung et al., 2015;Dobrenel et al., 2016;Dodds and Lagudah, 2016;Kühn, 2016;Li and Sheen, 2016;Baena-González and Hanson, 2017).Plants have developed complex sugar-sensing systems to monitor and respond to continuous fluctuations in sugar status caused by the circadian clock and frequent environmental changes (Stitt and Zeeman, 2012).\nMultiple recent studies have revealed significant roles of sugar in plant growth (Lastdrager et al., 2014) and development (Wingler, 2018).For example, sugar availability to axillary buds is a key determinant for shoot branching.Removal of pea shoot tips induces a sufficient flow of sugar into axillary buds to repress the expression of the branching inhibitor gene Branched1, which highlights the importance of sugars in mediating apical dominance (Mason et al., 2014).Sugars in photosynthetic leaves function as mobile signals to repress the expression of microRNA156 and thus promote the maturation of juvenile plants (Yu et al., 2013).\nImportant sugar responses are also found in roots, whose growth depends on Suc transported from photosynthetic leaves.This dependence underscores the importance of understanding the effects of sugars on root growth and development.Although sugar controls primary and lateral root growth in a dose-dependent manner (Freixes et al., 2002), sugar demand in roots continuously changes due to environmental signals (Lemoine et al., 2013) and developmental stages.Having a sugar-sensing system in roots that can efficiently monitor sugar levels would be important for root and whole-plant growth.However, studies of sugar signaling in roots are generally scant.\nRoot growth is closely associated with sugar concentrations (Thompson et al., 2017).Greater soluble sugar content has been found in fast-growing roots of pruned barley plants, whereas slow-growing barley roots contain less soluble sugar (Farrar and Jones, 1986).Suc generated by photosynthesis in cotyledons is required to regulate primary root growth (Kircher and Schopfer, 2012).Suc promotes primary root elongation in a dose-dependent manner.The higher the exogenous Suc concentration, the faster primary roots elongate (Freixes et al., 2002).Furthermore, the finding that neighboring secondary roots in the same root system have different growth rates in their elongation zone as a function of local sugar concentration also favors the conclusion that sugar is a major determinant of root growth (Freixes et al., 2002).\nBecause local sugar concentrations play critical roles in regulating root growth, it is important to learn more about the mechanisms that control sugar transport into the growing zones of the root.Sugars generated by photosynthesis in leaves are loaded into sieve elements of the phloem and then delivered by phloem into roots (De Schepper et al., 2013).According to pressure flow theory, it is the osmotic differential in phloem sieve elements that drives the bulk flow from source photosynthetic organs to sink organs such as roots.After sugar reaches its destination, it must be unloaded from phloem sieve elements into surrounding cells.Ross-Elliott et al. (2017) have proposed that after sugar reaches the connecting tissue between conducting phloem and sink tissues, called protophloem, it is unloaded into surrounding cells through funnel plasmodesmata and then diffuses freely along a concentration gradient into cells of the root tip in a symplastic way.The unloading of sugar into the elongation zone, mitotic zone, and root cap accommodates the highenergy demands of fast-growing regions in roots.Here, we describe the effect of knocking out two of the eight members of the annexin gene family in Arabidopsis, namely ANN1 and ANN2, on the diffusion of sugars from the unloading zone to root tips, and we discuss how these two annexins play an important mechanistic role in post-phloem transport of sugars into root tips.",

    "text": "The regulatory roles of sugar in photosynthetic gene transcripts and photosynthesis capacity have been widely documented (Koch, 1996;Pego et al., 2000).Sugar starvation in plants activates photosynthesis, whereas high sugar levels inhibit photosynthesis (Yu et al., 2015;Sami et al., 2016).Sugar represses the transcriptional activity of photosynthetic gene promoters transiently expressed in maize mesophyll protoplasts   (Sheen, 1990).Sugar accumulation in leaves represses photosynthetic gene expression and photosynthesis (Pego et al., 2000).Roots are typical sink organs.Sugar demands in young roots promote photosynthesis in leaves.For example, overexpression of the HIGHER YIELD RICE gene encoding an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR transcription factor leads to increased root length, branching, and strength, which in turn promotes photosynthesis in leaves (Ambavaram et al., 2014).However, the mechanism of how plants monitor sugar levels in roots remains an active area of investigation.Here, we hypothesize that root tips are sugar-sensing tissues, and their sugar status can affect photosynthesis capacity in leaves.\nAs noted above, our results revealed sugar starvation in the actively growing root apex of the ann1-2 and ann2-1 knockout mutants by using CF as a phloem mobile probe.Evidence that this apical sugar starvation led to an up-regulation of photosynthesis was indicated by the up-regulated expression of genes encoding CAB2 (LHCB1.1),CAB3 (LHCB 1.2), and PSII subunits (LHB1B1 and LHB1B2), along with increased chlorophyll contents in ann1-2.The enhancement of photosynthesis in ann1-2 was most likely the change that resulted in the elevated sugar contents observed in primary roots of ann1-2.However, because these accumulated sugars could not reach the root apex due to the defective post-phloem transport of sugars in ann1-2, they failed to rescue primary root growth defects and to reverse the enhancement of photosynthesis.Assuming that sugars accumulate in the phloem and unloading zone without sufficient diffusion into the post-phloem region, this transport defect would lead to sugar starvation in root tips.Because roots can communicate their nutrient status to shoots and induce responses in them (Ko and Helariutta, 2017), the stress of sugar starvation in root tips could initiate a root-to-shoot signal, just as salt stress in roots promote the propagation of Ca 2+ waves from roots to shoots (Choi et al., 2014;Evans et al., 2016).Plausibly, such a signal could help explain how sugar-deprived root tips could induce the up-regulation of photosynthetic genes in leaves.\nRoots efficiently take up Suc and Glc from the media (Chaudhuri et al., 2008), and consistently, exogenously supplied sugars in the medium successfully rescued primary root growth defects and reversed photosynthesis enhancement in ann1-2.These results favor the conclusion that ANN1 helps control root sugar status, which would result in feedback regulation of photosynthesis.Knocking out ANN1 may result in sugar starvation in roots, which could serve as a signal for plants to up-regulate photosynthesis.",

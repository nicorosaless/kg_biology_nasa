    "summary": "The study addresses the challenge of rapidly assessing the viability of microbial cells from different phylogenetic lineages within complex microbial communities. Traditional methods have limitations in speed and accuracy, particularly in distinguishing between viable, dormant, and non-viable cells. Advanced molecular approaches like live-dead staining and RNA probing have been developed, but can overestimate viable cell numbers or face purification and stability issues. This research combines propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment with high-throughput pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to improve understanding of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms, differentiating between live and dead cells across various phylogenetic lineages.",

Samples were processed using biological sampling kits, concentrated via centrifugal filtration, and divided into PMA-treated (viability assessment) and untreated (total DNA) aliquots. DNA was extracted using an automated system. PMA treatment involved incubating samples with PMA in the dark to inhibit DNA amplification from dead cells.",

MOTUs are based on DNA sequence variation, separating evolutionary events from methodological errors, and PTUs rely on hybridization scores of 25-mer probes, representing the 16S rRNA gene. Microorganisms were assigned to a single MOTU/PTU based on sequence similarity or hybridization score.",

Hybridization intensities were transformed for analysis. PTUs were grouped at the genus level, and enrichment in PMA-treated samples was determined based on presence and higher transformed hybridization intensity compared to non-PMA-treated samples. Representative 16S rRNA gene sequences were used to compile a phylogenetic tree. Tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) was performed using bacterial-biased primers to amplify V1-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene.",

After PMA treatment, only a small percentage of the total bacterial population in SAF (4-7%) and Bldg 144 (7-21%) was determined to be viable. bTEFAP analysis showed a higher number of bacterial MOTUs in Bldg 144 compared to SAF, with PMA treatment significantly reducing MOTU counts in both locations. PhyloChip analysis revealed a drastic decrease in bacterial genera after PMA treatment, with SAF samples showing a simple bacterial community structure dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria.",

The findings reveal significant differences in viable bacterial communities between cleanrooms with and without spacecraft hardware, with the latter exhibiting greater diversity. This study provides valuable insights into the distribution and phylogenetic affiliation of viable bacteria in these critical environments, informing strategies for contamination control and planetary protection.",

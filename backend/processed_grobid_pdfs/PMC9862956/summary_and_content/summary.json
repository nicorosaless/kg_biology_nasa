    "summary": "The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a relevant model for phenotypic screening in basic biology, drug screening, and disease studies due to its small size, fast reproductive cycle, and translational relevance. Its advantages as a genetic model translate to spaceflight, enabling cost-effective studies of microgravity and radiation effects. However, conducting animal experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) requires stringent control of payload size, weight, and crew time. Standard microscopes are common for C. elegans phenotyping, but increasing assay throughput and reducing costs have led to the development of custom imaging solutions. This paper introduces a compact imaging platform (CIP) designed to address these needs.",

      "summary": "The compact imaging platform (CIP) was designed considering lightweight, compactness, and low power consumption, crucial for both Earth and spaceflight applications. The CIP has dimensions of 7.5 cm length, 4.5 cm width, and 5.5 cm height, with a footprint of approximately 34 inÂ² and a weight of approximately 700 g. The mechanical design comprises two Polyamide 12 nylon sections connected by hinges, fabricated using multi-jet fusion 3D printing. The top section houses an iPod Touch camera, while the bottom section contains LED lights and a cooling fan. Ventilation slots facilitate thermal equilibrium in temperature-controlled environments.",

      "summary": "The CIP's ability to image C. elegans on different substrates like agar plates, liquid drops, and microfluidic devices was tested. The system produced sufficient-quality images, allowing easy segmentation of adult animals using standard image processing software like ImageJ. These substrates have varied refractive indices and optical path lengths, the CIP proved capable of visualizing animals effectively across them all. Standard image processing techniques can be used to quantify phenotypic readouts.",

      "summary": "C. elegans behavior is temperature-sensitive, necessitating environmental temperature control during assays. The small size of the CIP allows it to be placed in a temperature-controlled incubator. The CIP is an enclosed system that houses the C. elegans substrates during imaging. Ventilation slots and a cooling fan were implemented to address heat generated by the LED lights. Experiments demonstrated the CIP's ability to maintain stable temperatures, showing almost identical temperature data for the LED chamber and the microfluidic chip.",

      "summary": "The CIP was validated by performing behavioral assays on plates, liquid drops, and microfluidic chips. Wild-type animals were tested on Nematode Growth Media (NGM) plates, and locomotory readouts were compared with literature data. Average forward speed was approximately 0.14 mm/s, and body wave frequency was approximately 0.39 Hz. Similar tests were conducted in microfluidic chips, with average forward speed and body wave frequency found to be approximately 0.10 mm/s and approximately 0.25 Hz, respectively. Figure 4 shows the overlay of tracks made by animals in the three substrates.",

These mutants exhibit distinct behavioral phenotypes. The unc-32(e189) mutation results in a reverse ventral coiling phenotype, while the unc-79(e1068) mutation causes a \"fainting\" phenotype.",

  "conclusion": "The study reports a compact imaging platform (CIP) and demonstrates its use in acquiring whole-organism phenotypic data across various C. elegans substrates. Temperature control is achievable, and multiple CIP units can conduct parallel experiments. Acquired videos are compatible with established software tools for analysis. The CIP hardware can be further enhanced with high-magnification optics. Its simplicity makes the CIP useful for research and educational settings on Earth and a promising tool for C. elegans studies on the ISS.",

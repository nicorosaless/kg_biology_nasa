    "summary": "The paper introduces Japan's first in-space mouse habitat unit (MHU), developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) for use on the International Space Station's (ISS) \"KIBO\" Japanese Experiment Module (JEM). The unit facilitated a mouse-rearing experiment from July to August 2016, resulting in the successful return of all mice alive, a first for long-term space stays. The MHU addresses limitations of previous habitat units, such as accommodating individual mice and mitigating contamination.",

Mice are transferred to the habitat unit within the glove box after arriving at the ISS. The habitat unit is then installed inside the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF). The glove box is utilized for tasks such as transferring mice and cleaning cages.",

Each cage unit houses one mouse and is designed to be compact and lightweight due to space limitations inside the CBEF. Verification tests, approved by the JAXA animal care committee and supervised by a veterinarian, were conducted to validate the design.",

      "summary": "Each cage unit is designed for a single mouse, prioritizing compactness and lightweight construction due to installation constraints. Ventilation is crucial in microgravity, achieved with redundant fans promoting unidirectional airflow from ceiling to waste collection. A deodorizing filter removes gases like ammonia. Habitat dimensions are optimized for resource constraints.",

It is designed for use with the ISS Locker or Cargo Transfer Bag (CTB) and features compact airflow channels and redundant ventilation fans. A control system adjusts fan speed to meet noise and wind speed requirements. The deodorizing filter has the same composition as in the habitat cage units.",

      "summary": "The first Mouse Epigenetics experiment ran from July to August 2016, focusing on long-term mouse-rearing, gene expression changes, and epigenomic shifts in different gravity environments, as well as transgenerational effects. The MHU's technical demonstration was also a goal. Mice were launched via SpaceX Dragon (CRS-9). The in-orbit experiment lasted 35 days, with regular maintenance. All 12 mice returned alive, marking a successful long-term space stay. Astronauts conducted the operation with ethics committee approval.",

Future in-orbit mouse-rearing experiments are planned, building upon lessons from the initial mission.",

The goal is to identify genes showing transcriptional abundance under spaceflight microgravity, particularly those influencing root growth and cell wall biosynthesis. Graph-theoretic approaches, including LASSO, Pearson correlation, and HITS algorithm, are employed to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from GeneLab datasets GLDS-7 and GLDS-120.",

A novel graph-theoretic approach identified hub genes significantly different in spaceflight microgravity. The WS ecotype GRN in spaceflight has the highest spectral gap. Thirty-eight genes with higher transcriptions in spaceflight microgravity are involved in vital functions. Hub genes with higher transcriptional activity are identified, involved in the cell wall response process only in spaceflight, including xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolases (XTHs).",

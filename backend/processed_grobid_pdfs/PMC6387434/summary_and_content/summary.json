  "intro": "Long-duration space travel poses health risks to astronauts, with space radiation and microgravity being key factors. Space radiation on the ISS differs from that on Earth, comprising protons and HZE ions. While HZE ions' carcinogenic potential is a major concern for missions beyond LEO, LEO radiation primarily consists of low-energy protons.",

High-energy protons and other GCR ions accounted for 58% of the dose, and low-energy protons in the SAA contributed 42%. The actual dose to the samples may have been slightly lower due to incubator shielding. The distinction between particle energy and LET is important, with both high- and low-energy protons having relatively low LET.",

The majority of pathways were downregulated after radiation exposure in cardiomyocytes, consistent with observations in HUVEC spaceflight samples. ROS pathways were also downregulated, indicating a decrease in ROS production. Fatty acid metabolism, which is linked to ROS formation, was also downregulated. This suggests an immediate and persistent impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system.",

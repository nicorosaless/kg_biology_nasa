    "summary": "This study investigates the impact of space conditions on wheat kernel characteristics, addressing the need for sustainable food production during long-term space missions. Prior research has shown that lettuce can be grown in space with similar quality to Earth-grown lettuce, but the quality of grain crops in space is not well understood. This research aims to determine if growing wheat in space affects the weight, parameters, asymmetry, and starch composition of the grain.",

However, the perimeter, depth, and roundness of the kernels did not show statistically significant differences. Coefficients of variation were below 15%, indicating relatively homogeneous samples. Large kernels predominated in both samples, with a slightly higher proportion in the ISS sample.",

The first method, using perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry, did not detect significant differences between the left and right sides of the kernel. The second method, comparing the length of the left and right sides, revealed differences in kernels grown on the ISS, while the control group showed no significant differences in distances from the endosperm folds to the axis of symmetry.",

The control group had 38 kernels shifted leftward and nine rightward. The fluctuating asymmetry (FA) scale indicated low to very low asymmetry levels in both ISS and control kernels, with no significant differences in FA between the two groups. Figure 10 shows the correlation of kernels according to the level of fluctuating asymmetry in both experimental variants.",

Type B granules were more aligned, with lower variability. The length of type A starch granules in mature ISS kernels was significantly longer than in Earth kernels. The ratio of type B to type A starch was 5% less in mature ISS kernels and 8% less in puny ISS kernels. Figure 5 shows the distribution of starch grains by granule type.",

  "conclusion": "This study presents data on the asymmetry of wheat kernels grown in near-space conditions, revealing relationships with other kernel characteristics. No significant differences were found in the main parameters of kernels from ISS and Earth-grown wheat. ISS kernels had 5-8% less type B starch and a smaller aleurone layer cell width. The reduction in the protein component of the endosperm suggests increased stress during seed formation in space. Growing plants from seeds in space offers prospects for sustainable food production in closed-cycle environments. Future research should focus on modifying growth chambers for improved aeration.",

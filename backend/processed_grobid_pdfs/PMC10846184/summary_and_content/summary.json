Figure 2 shows significant discrepancy between Biolog data vs. How can the authors justify the following assumptions?a. \"For simulations using community FBA, the metabolic models of both organisms were merged into one microbial community model\" -I believe individual models were merged as a compartmentalized model (rather than mixed-bag), but it needs to be mentioned.b. Reviewer #2 (Comments for the Author):\nThe presented study uses metabolic models, a defined coculture of bacteria, and C. elegans as a host for the coculture.The stated goal is to develop precision prebiotics to engineer microbiome composition. The manuscript needs major revisions before it is ready for publication. The first section of the results section analyzes human microbiome metagenome data.This is a distraction from the rest of the paper which examines a C. elegans coculture.Please remove the human microbiome section.The data could be better applied to a different study further detailing the classic power law relationship between a community property and its frequency. The document states that 100 mM of serine (10 g/L) results in a change in the frequency of the target species in the C."

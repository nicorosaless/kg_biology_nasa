    "text": "BackgroundThe extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat.Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.\nResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS.Using a deep-learning based tool-deepFRI-we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools.Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms.Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits.The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism.In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters.These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.\nConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space.Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome.The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.",

    "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
    "text": "The environment of outer space, characterized by intense radiation and high vacuum, presents harsh conditions for any form of life.Despite this, microorganisms have demonstrated a remarkable adaptability to these extreme space environments.Organisms known as extremophiles, such as bacteria (e.g., Bacillus, Deinococcus species) [1,2], fungi [3], tardigrades [4], bdelloid rotifers [5], and many others, are well-documented for their ability to survive in space conditions.As such, it is virtually impossible to prevent the transfer of microbial life to exploratory space vessels or planets [6,7].In addition to microorganisms potentially hitching a ride with robotic components, the microbiomes of humans also travel to space.This not only includes the microbiomes of space crew members, but also free-living microorganisms associated with cargo, science instruments, and test animals, including potential pathogens which should be considered for their potential to adapt to space conditions [8][9][10][11][12][13].\nThe exposure of microbes to outer space, or simulated versions of these conditions, has been extensively studied to test survival capabilities and assess the panspermia hypothesis.Over several decades, various microbial samples have been exposed to space conditions via balloons, rockets, and spacecraft as part of the pioneering experiments in astrobiology (reviewed in [14]).For example, after 18 months of exposure, Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032, a bacterium isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Spacecraft Assembly Facility (JPL-SAF), exhibited 10-40% survivability when UV was masked [1].However, when these SAFR-032 spores were exposed to UV light (above 110 nm) and vacuum in space for 18 months, except for a few spores, there was a roughly 7-log reduction in viability.Similarly, dried Deinococcus cell pellets, particularly those 500 μm in thickness, remained viable after three years of space exposure due to a shadowing effect.Moreover, D. radiodurans after being subjected to 1-year exposure to outer space during Tanpopo mission [15], showed a collection of molecular alterations, e.g., DNA damage and oxidative stress response and accumulation of metal transporters.In a recent study, a survival of D. radiodurans exposed to near space conditions was correlated with a growth condition prior to the exposure [16].A comparative proteomics analysis of B. pumilus SAFR-032 revealed that proteins conferring resistance traits, such as superoxide dismutase, were present in higher concentrations in the vegetative cells derived from spores exposed to space compared to ground controls.Furthermore, the first-generation spores of B. pumilus SAFR-032 resulting from space-exposed samples demonstrated increased UVC resistance (around 4000 J/m 2 ) compared to their ground control counterparts [1].\nThe International Space Station (ISS) is a closed environment that houses a diverse range of microorganisms, including potential pathogens [17].As we prepare for long-term space explorations, understanding the molecular mechanisms that allow microorganisms to survive and adapt during spaceflight is becoming increasingly important [10,15].Monitoring the microbial population onboard the ISS is crucial for safeguarding astronaut health and preventing contamination of both the spacecraft and its equipment [7].Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotypic characterization of any novel microbial species discovered on the ISS can help identify potential pathogens and comprehend their impact on the closed habitat and crew health [7].However, to accurately identify potential microbial threats, it is essential to maintain a current and comprehensive database of microbial genomes, detailing both their species identities and phenotypic traits.This database, continuously updated through WGS of pure cultures, is crucial for gathering genetic data and assisting in the identification of microbial threats via shotgun metagenomic sequencing.Moreover, the active initiatives to characterize the cultivable microbiome of previously not sequenced space habitats contribute to decreasing the unidentified microbial 'dark matter' in metagenomic sequencing outcomes.\nResearch conducted in space or using ground-based simulators has shown that microgravity conditions can alter various biological processes, including growth, morphology, gene expression, virulence, drug resistance, biofilm formation, and secondary metabolism [8-10, 12, 18].Studies focusing on the microbiome have reported an increase in antibiotic resistance markers in astronauts' saliva [19], although these changes were temporary and reversed upon returning to Earth.Other research has indicated that microbial isolates from space environments are differentiating themselves from their Earthbound counterparts, showing signs of adaptation to their new environment [17,[20][21][22][23]. Interestingly, under spaceflight conditions, one species, Bacillus safensis JPL-MERTA-8-2, exhibited a 60% improvement in growth compared to its Earth-based growth [24].\nThis study focused on the genomic peculiarities of novel species isolated from the ISS and compared WGS of the closest relatives found in Earth environments.A thorough analysis was conducted on genes associated with DNA repair, radiation resistance, microgravity adaptation, stress responses, and metabolic changes (Fig. 1).These genes were compared to their terrestrial counterparts, and potential variations induced by space conditions were observed.The protein-coding sequences from each species pair were compared using a set of similarity metrics, unearthing potentially novel genes and clusters that might have been evolved in space.Furthermore, mutations within these sequences were rigorously analyzed, and their protein structures were predicted using in silico models.This approach illuminates the genetic adaptations undertaken in stringent conditions of the space environment.In essence, by comparing space and Earth genomes and identifying mutation patterns, a clearer insight into genetic evolution influenced by space conditions has been obtained.",

    "heading": "DISCUSSION",
    "text": "The thorough examination of genomes of five novel ISS bacterial species, when compared with their closest terrestrial counterparts, unveiled clear adaptations to the rigors of ISS space environment.Notably, significant shifts in cell physiology and metabolism were seen.The extent to which genes lacked homologs in their terrestrial relatives was found to be associated with their phylogenetic distance.A specific set of genes was discovered to be present in all isolates but absent in their closest terrestrial relatives.This observation is consistent with earlier findings on the ISS-specific evolutionary patterns [37,38].Mannose is a known substrate of glycosylation in prokaryotes [39] and thus may play a role in cell wall modifications, cell adhesion and biofilm formation.Moreover, genes related to beta-mannosidase and mannose activities were up-regulated in high salinity media in the brine shrimp Artemia salina [40], suggesting that mannose and its derivatives may be accumulated as organic osmolytes.Clusters associated with small molecule and peptide biosynthesis in fungi were found in abundance, reaffirming earlier studies into molecular responses to microgravity [11].The pool of novel genes unique to the ISS species (Supplementary Table S13) showed an abundance of genes related to peptide and small molecule synthesis, transmembrane secretion/transport, and mechanosensitive ion channels.This suggests they might have a defense mechanism against hypoosmotic shocks.Furthermore, novel surface oxidoreductases have been identified in M. mcarthurae and M. meiriae which are not present in their terrestrial analogs.In light of these findings, a deeper investigation using comparative transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics is recommended.To perform meta-omic analysis while cultivating these microorganisms on ISS would be very challenging.Nevertheless, such studies were conducted before, e.g., Tanpopo mission [15], although this study focused on meta-omic analyses post-exposure.Conducting in vivo experiments on microogranisms could be performed via simulating some of the conditions experienced in ISS, e.g., increased radiation, vacuum or microgravity.Ground facilities to recreate these conditions exist and has been utilized in such experiments before ( [41][42][43], also reviewed in [10]).It would therefore be possible to compare gene expression profile under these conditions, protein activity (e.g., extracellular metallopeptidases) or even assay secretion of certain metabolites (e.g., chelators, antibiotics) on indicative media.\nEfficient DNA repair and its impact on survival in the extreme conditions has long been studied in many organisms [41,44,45].LexA repressor-mediated response is known to be crucial to DNA protection and repair process [46].Studies on extremophilic bdelloid rotifers highlighted the linkage of efficient DNA repair mechanisms with the presence of high rates of HGT [47,48].The detection of MGEs underscores a significant genetic factor hinting at the selective pressures faced by species isolated from the ISS.Interestingly, the quantity of annotated transposases seems to be in proportion to genome size, with P. vandeheii genome showcasing the most substantial presence of MGEs.On the other hand, transposable elements were not detected in all ISS species, thus suggesting that TE-mediated genome rearrangements are not a common route for genomic adaptations to space environment.Given that microgravity and hypoosmotic shock may induce dessication stress, the adaptation mechanisms may be similar to dessication-tolerant organisms, e.g., bdelloid rotifers, where TEs are highly diverged [49] and containing unique ORFs, thus indicating a domestication.Hence, it is possible that in the species described in this study the TEs are significantly diverged.Extremophilic lifestyle provides selective pressure on maintaining genome integrity.Therefore, TEs disruptive activity is expected to be quenched, at least in the non-spore forming species.On the other hand, P. vandeheii may have a different adaptation system, being a spore-former (such as D. radiodurans, which is known to contain TEs that are a part of stress-response [50]).Notably, sequences tied to plasmid-specific genes, such as mobC and relaxase, were discerned in both Microbacterium species, a feature absent in their terrestrial analogs.This emphasizes the potential unique genetic adaptations of these space-borne bacteria.\nBuilding upon established research [33,47], our analysis of proteomic alterations points to a significant enrichment across various protein classes.A particularly noteworthy observation is the global glycine enrichment, a phenomenon that aligns with findings from earlier studies on Acinetobacter sp., a desiccation-tolerant organism [17,37,51].Historically, these organisms have not only displayed enhanced hydrophilicity but have also shown a fortified resistance to ionizing radiation, a stress factor intrinsically tied to redox reactions.The emphasis on these genetic mechanisms holds paramount importance, especially in the context of space-related stress factors.As organisms venture into space, they confront an array of unique and potent stressors, including elevated radiation, microgravity, and vacuum conditions.The genetic adaptability and resilience exhibited by certain organisms, as demonstrated by their proteomic profiles and specific enrichments, provide invaluable insights.These genetic mechanisms might well be the key to understanding how life can persist, and perhaps thrive, in the harsh environs of space.Such knowledge not only expands our understanding of extremophile biology but also informs potential biotechnological applications and space colonization strategies in the future.\nWhen looking at the singular case of metallopeptidase (aminopeptidase N) from M. meiriae and its closelyrelated Earth counterpart Microbacterium sp.LTR1, we observed almost perfect structure alignment, despite 43% sequence similarity.The changes in amino acid composition reflect the adaptations to the lifestyle of M. meiriae, with enrichment of arginine(s) and methionine(s), with the subsequent reduction of lysine and asparagine.Arginine is known to provide more stability to the structure than lysine [52][53][54].Methionine in proteins plays an important role in cellular antioxidant activity, protein structure stabilization, and sequence-independent recognition of protein surfaces.It can also act as a regulatory switch through reversible oxidation and reduction (reviewed in [55]).This could hence explain its presence in the catalytic site (HEXXH motif ) of aminopeptidase N.\nDrawing from foundational work such as that by Daly et al. [33], metalloproteins stand out as a consistently enriched protein class in strains adapted to space conditions.This enrichment pattern mirrors the remarkable adaptations seen in organisms like D. radiodurans, which has gained attention for its extraordinary radiation resistance [41].The prominence of these metaldependent enzymes in space-adapted strains is not merely a coincidence.These enzymes play a pivotal role in efficiently managing the redox stress that such microorganisms face in space.Their enrichment suggests an enhanced capability for early stress detection, with these enzymes acting as both environmental sensors and transcription factors.This is a vital adaptation, as space presents a plethora of unique stressors, with redox imbalances being a major concern.The ability of certain strains to bolster their defense mechanisms, as evidenced by the enrichment of specific proteins, reveals the intricate genetic adaptations that enable survival in such hostile settings.These findings not only deepen our grasp of astrobiology but also have profound implications for potential biotechnological applications, hinting at ways to engineer organisms or systems for better resilience in space or other extreme conditions.The extreme ISS environment explains the need for metals scavenging to balance the redox stress, e.g., in the form of metalloproteins.The study of metallopeptidases is essential in the context of microbial adaptation to space conditions due to their significant roles in protein degradation, regulation of biological functions, and contribution to microbial virulence and biofilm formation [30].This research is vital for ensuring the health and safety of astronauts, maintaining the integrity of space missions, and exploring new biotechnological applications.On the other hand, the prevalence of genes such as hemolysins, ferrochelatases, as well as protein glycosylation (mannose), antibiotic resistance and biofilm pathways indicates the risk of potential pathogenicity of the ISSinhabiting microorganisms.These genes also appear in the genomes of their closest terrestrial relatives, but more studies needed to validate whether microgravity enhance the antibiotic resistance and biofilm production [56].Conversely, these observations highlight the importance of metal uptake systems, which could lead to the development of antimicrobial agents utilized in the space habitat.Hemolysins are known to be repressed upon high Fe concentrations, as they are tools to scavenge it from the environment.On the other hand, LexAmediated stress response is known to initiate bacteriocin synthesis [57].Thiopeptide antibiotic called TP-1161 has been detected in the ISS organism A. burdickii [28] and the presence of BGCs encoding potentially novel antimicrobial molecules in the genomes of remaining four ISS species has been confirmed.Therefore, these organisms may serve as a source of potential new antimicrobial agents available upon spaceflight.\nIn summary, the present study underscored the benefits of deep learning-based annotations, here using DeepFRI [58], which are able to go beyond the limitations of homology-based tools like PGAP and eggNOG [59].In fact, DeepFRI enabled the construction of a comprehensive and cohesive picture of adaptations to space conditions.Nevertheless, combined use of annotations derived from all tools was applied to, e.g., mechanosensitive ion channel proteins (see Section 2.3.2).While traditional tools often relegated these genes to the ambiguous \"hypothetical\" category, DeepFRI was adept at providing precise annotations.This allowed for the discernment of novel BGCs, a finding that was further corroborated using specialized tools such as ant-iSMASH [28,60].In addition, a significant portion of these novel annotations pertained to membrane-associated proteins.This resonates with prior observations highlighting membrane-related adjustments.The challenge of studying the membrane proteome cannot be understated.Yet, with the recent augmentation of databases like AlphaFold [27] and ESM atlas [61], the scientific community has been endowed with a richer repository of membrane-bound protein structures.This surge in data availability paves the way for more refined structure-based annotations of novel genomes.\nThis deep dive into the genetic underpinnings bears profound significance, especially when contextualized within space-related stress factors.As organisms confront the multifaceted challenges of space, their genetic machinery undergoes intricate recalibrations.By harnessing sophisticated annotation tools, we gain unparalleled insights into these genetic adaptations, potentially unlocking the secrets of space resilience.Such revelations not only propel our understanding of astrobiology forward but also spotlight the potential of genetic mechanisms in tailoring organisms for optimal performance in extraterrestrial environments.",

  "intro": "On Earth, mechanical loading is crucial for maintaining tissue health and regeneration. In space, the absence of gravity diminishes mechanical stimulation, leading to physiological responses such as bone and muscle loss, and cardiovascular alterations. This study investigates the short-term effects of microgravity on bone, focusing on osteoclast, osteoblast, and osteocyte activity.",

The results confirm bone loss in the ischium portion of the pelvis, accompanied by a reduction in trabecular bridges. There were also significant increases in osteoclast numbers. The observed rate of bone loss is high compared to long-term astronaut bone loss values. The high-levels of osteoclastic activity may subside after the initial transition to microgravity. In addition, bone loss was accompanied by large increases in osteoclast numbers and osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces measured in the femoral head.",

  "conclusion": "The findings demonstrate the pelvic-femoral musculoskeletal complex is sensitive to load and gravity, making it a valuable model to study muscle and bone degeneration in space. Bone responses to spaceflight are complex and involve osteoclastic, osteoblastic, and osteocytic degenerative responses. The findings on CDKN1a/p21 up-regulation in microgravity have the potential to become a major concern for tissue regenerative health in long-duration spaceflight. Future studies should address the specific molecular regulatory mechanisms of CDKN1a/p21 involvement in tissue degeneration during long-term spaceflight.",

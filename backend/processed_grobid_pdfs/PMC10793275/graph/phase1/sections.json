    "text": "Annotations were predicted with Prokka [v1.14.6 (12)], given S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis references (Table 1), and used for orthogroup-based phylogeny construc tion with Orthofinder  The WGS phylogeny (Fig. 1) confirms that Sph5 is closest to S. paucimobilis while related to S. sanguinis.As a result, S. paucimobilis reference genomes were used for RagTag [v2.1.0(16)] scaffolding of Sph5 contigs.ASM1602843v1 was the best scaffold (93.6% total length in three longest contigs of resulting assembly).Realignment of raw reads to ASM1602843v1scaffolded Sph5 assembly with BWA [v0.7.17 (17)], SamTools [v1.12 (18)], and Picard [v2.25.0 (19)], evaluated by Mosdepth [v0.3.3 (20)], supports this (99.48%reads aligned, 1,089× coverage).\nRe-annotation with Prokka predicts 4,321 CDS, 3 rRNAs, 54 tRNAs, 1 tmRNA, and 1 repeat region.Of the CDS, 3,342 could be functionally annotated.",

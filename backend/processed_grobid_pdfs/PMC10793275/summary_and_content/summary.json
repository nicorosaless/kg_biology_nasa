    "summary": "This paper reports the draft genome sequence of Sphingomonas strain Sph5, isolated from a tap water filtration membrane. Sphingomonadaceae are common membrane colonizers and biofilm formers, and this study contributes to understanding long-term genetic changes in drinking water biofilm species. The isolate was identified as Sphingomonas paucimobilis through whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly, providing insights into strain-specific traits associated with membrane biofouling, given that Sphingomonas spp. are prevalent in drinking water biofilms.",

Assembly was performed using SPADES, and contigs were aligned to NCBI databases. Completeness was estimated using BUSCO, revealing high completeness (97.7% complete and single copy). Nineteen million 2 Ã— 150 bp reads were obtained on a NovaSeq (Illumina), with an average Phred score of 33-36.",

Orthogroup-based phylogeny construction was performed with Orthofinder, confirming that Sph5 is closest to S. paucimobilis, but related to S. sanguinis (Fig. 1). RagTag was used for scaffolding, and the resulting assembly was realigned with BWA, SamTools, and Picard. Re-annotation with Prokka predicts 4,321 CDS, 3 rRNAs, 54 tRNAs, 1 tmRNA, and 1 repeat region. Of the CDS, 3,342 could be functionally annotated.",

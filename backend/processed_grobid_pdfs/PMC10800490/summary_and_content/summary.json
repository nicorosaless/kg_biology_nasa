    "summary": "Plants are crucial for long-duration space missions, necessitating an understanding of their adaptation to space environments. Transcriptional profiling has been used to study plant adaptation to microgravity, but results across experiments often vary due to differing conditions and hardware, making it difficult to isolate the effects of microgravity. This study analyzes data from two spaceflight experiments, Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR), conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS), which provided a lighted environment and onboard 1 g control via centrifugation.",

PS included an initial 48-hour 1 g treatment, while the PRR microgravity rotor remained stationary. A morphological difference was noted: PS seedlings had uniform root orientation, while PRR seedlings had disordered growth patterns. Each experiment yielded sufficient plant tissue for analysis.",

      "summary": "Individual analyses of PS and PRR identified 1,819 and 1,792 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between microgravity and the 1 g control, respectively, with significant overlap. Common upregulated genes were enriched in \"Regulation of Transcription\" and \"Auxin Signaling,\" while downregulated genes were enriched in \"Cell Wall\" and \"Response to Stress.\" A combined analysis reinforced these enrichments, identifying 1,112 upregulated and 1,429 downregulated genes. Genes upregulated in microgravity compared to the 1 g control were primarily involved in leaf and shoot development.",

      "summary": "The combined analysis showed strong enrichment of genes associated with DNA transcription, with 159 transcription factors (TFs) upregulated in microgravity, mostly regulating shoot meristem and leaf growth. Auxin transport and signaling genes were also prominent, including auxin efflux carriers, auxin response factors (ARFs), and small auxin upregulated (SAUR) genes. SAURs were highly upregulated, with several induced more than 2-fold and implicated in light-regulated cotyledon and hypocotyl development.",

Abiotic and biotic stress responses were suppressed. The downregulated DEGs include 120 TFs primarily involved in regulating stress responses, ethylene response factors (ERFs), and WRKY TFs. Approximately 200 genes were associated with plant defense and response to biotic stimuli.",

      "heading": "Microgravity Versus Space Environment",
      "summary": "A striking aspect was the downregulation of stress response genes in PS and PRR, contrasting with reports of upregulation in spaceflight experiments compared to ground controls. Analysis showed that many of these stress response genes were upregulated in 1 g compared to ground controls, indicating that the space environment enhances their expression. However, microgravity specifically downregulated this group of genes compared to 1 g, suggesting it masks the induction of stress responses.",

A substantial portion of the downregulated miRNA target gene products were localized in the plastid. Correlation analysis of miR319c and miR863-5p and their predicted mRNA targets was conducted.",

  "conclusion": "These experiments revealed conserved transcriptional responses to microgravity in plants, highlighting the importance of onboard 1 g controls. Upregulated genes were primarily involved in leaf and shoot development, while downregulated genes were associated with stress responses. This study provides insights into how plants adapt to the unique challenges of the space environment and underscores the importance of multi-omic approaches and replicated spaceflight experiments for future research.",

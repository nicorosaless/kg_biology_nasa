    "text": "Introduction: Understanding how plants adapt to the space environment is essential, as plants will be a valuable component of long duration space missions.Several spaceflight experiments have focused on transcriptional profiling as a means of understanding plant adaptation to microgravity.However, there is limited overlap between results from different experiments.Differences in experimental conditions and hardware make it difficult to find a consistent response across experiments and to distinguish the primary effects of microgravity from other spaceflight effects.Methods: Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) were two separate spaceflight experiments conducted on the International Space Station utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS).The EMCS provided a lighted environment for plant growth with centrifugal capabilities providing an onboard 1 g control.Results and discussion: An RNA-Seq analysis of shoot samples from PS and PRR revealed a significant overlap of genes differentially expressed in microgravity between the two experiments.Relative to onboard 1 g controls, genes involved in transcriptional regulation, shoot development, and response to auxin and light were upregulated in microgravity in both experiments.Conversely, genes involved in defense response, abiotic stress, Ca ++ signaling, and cell wall modification were commonly downregulated in both datasets.The downregulation of stress responses in microgravity in these two experiments is interesting as these pathways have been previously observed as upregulated in spaceflight compared to ground controls.Similarly, we have observed many stress response genes to be upregulated in the 1 g onboard control compared to ground reference controls; however these genes were specifically downregulated in microgravity.In addition, we analyzed the sRNA landscape of the 1 g and microgravity (m g) shoot samples from PRR.We identified three miRNAs (miR319c, miR398b, and miR8683) Frontiers in Plant Science frontiersin.org01",

    "text": "As an essential part of life support systems for long-duration space missions, plants supplement food as well as purify the air and water (Fu et al., 2016;De Micco et al., 2023).Future colonization efforts will require the ability to grow plants in unfamiliar environments.However, the space environment poses challenges to growing plants.In addition to the difficulties of providing essential requirements for plant growth (light, water, nutrients, etc.), growing plants in space requires the mitigation of unfavorable factors such as altered gas composition, lack of convective currents, and cosmic radiation.\nIt is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate plant adaptations to space.Toward that goal, several spaceflight experiments have examined the global transcriptional changes of plants grown on the International Space Station (ISS).One caveat to these studies is that until recently, lighted habitats for plant experimentation were limited; for ease of handling and setup, several experiments were carried out in Biological Research In Canisters hardware (BRICs), where plants were grown in the dark.Another point of concern is that many spaceflight experiments have employed hardware-matched experiments on Earth as controls; however, it is difficult to replicate all of the stresses that plants may face on the ISS on the ground.\nFurther, while several transcriptional datasets have been generated (accessible through the NASA GeneLab data repository), differences in plant age, tissue type, and growth conditions confound efforts to separate primary responses to microgravity from other spaceflight related stress responses (Manzano et al., 2022;Olanrewaju et al., 2023).A recent metaanalysis by Barker et al. clearly illustrates some of these confounding effects (Barker et al., 2023).The authors showed that the analysis method (RNA-Seq vs. microarrays) was a principal factor leading to variability between datasets as was the hardware utilized for the spaceflight experiments.Nevertheless, focusing only on experiments conducted in BRIC hardware helped uncover common responses.Namely, oxidative stress, heat shock, cell wall dynamics, hypoxia, and ROS signaling were Gene Ontology annotations enriched in spaceflight compared to ground controls.\nA transcriptional profiling study of 12 day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware found organ-specific gene expression changes between leaves, hypocotyls, and roots (Paul et al., 2013).Although each tissue exhibited unique responses, cell wall remodeling, touch response, and pathogen responses were common themes among the genes differentially expressed in space.\nPlant growth is highly responsive to external cues.Two critical cues -light and gravity-have profound influences on the direction and magnitude of plant growth.Plant roots grow down with the gravity vector (positive gravitropism), while the stems grow opposite to the gravity vector (negative gravitropism) and toward light (positive phototropism).On earth, light and gravity work in combination to direct the orientation of the primary axes of growth as well as root and shoot branching and leaf angle, enabling efficient nutrient acquisition and light capture.The relative contribution of each of these cues in regulating plant growth is difficult to disentangle on Earth, where gravity is a constant; the ISS provides an ideal platform to answer such fundamental questions.\nThe European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) was one of the controlled environment plant growth habitats operational on the ISS for many years (Brinckmann, 1999;Kittang et al., 2014).In addition to providing lighting, regulated air circulation, and ethylene scrubbing, the EMCS was unique in that it consisted of two centrifuge rotors within a growth chamber.Rotor speeds could be varied to impart g levels ranging from 0 -2 g.The EMCS, therefore, afforded researchers the ability to conduct a simultaneous 1 g control in space as well as to specifically query the effects of partial gravity.\nSpaceflight experiments utilizing EMCS hardware have attempted to uncouple light and gravity stimuli (Millar et al., 2010;Vandenbrink et al., 2016).Some experiments have examined the transcriptional response of plants to partial g levels.We previously reported that a subset of genes differentially expressed in microgravity respond to incremental increases in g levels (Sheppard et al., 2021).Other researchers have compared differences in gene expression between Lunar or Martian gravity and onboard 1 g controls (Herranz et al., 2019;Villacampa et al., 2021).These types of experiments can inform us on plant responses to extraterrestrial habitats and will be important for aiding with long term colonization efforts.\nIn this study, we compare the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis shoots from two independent spaceflight experiments conducted on the ISS.In both experiments, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 5-6 days in the EMCS.The results revealed considerable overlap between the two experiments despite differences in the experimental setup.Furthermore, onboard 1 g controls facilitated the identification of microgravity-specific differences in gene expression.\n2 Materials and methods",

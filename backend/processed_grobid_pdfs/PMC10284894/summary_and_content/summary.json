NASA intends to leverage these missions to test Orion and the Human Landing System (HLS). The Gateway, a critical component for sustainable lunar operations, will be assembled with the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO), launching together in 2023. In 2024, Orion will transport the crew to lunar orbit, where they will transfer to a commercially developed lander for surface exploration using the new xEMU spacesuit for about a week.",

Orion will orbit Earth twice before traveling to the Moon, testing life support systems and Deep Space Network (DSN) communication. Crew will exercise and have limited down-time to contact family.

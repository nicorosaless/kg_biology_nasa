    "summary": "This study investigates the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the cytoskeletal protein and mRNA expression in mouse cardiac and lung tissues. Prior research indicates that microgravity induces negative changes in skeletal, muscle, and cardiovascular systems. While previous experiments faced limitations due to delayed tissue fixation post-landing, this research uniquely fixed mouse biomaterial onboard the International Space Station (ISS) after 37 days of weightlessness, allowing for a more accurate assessment of microgravity's impact before readaptation to Earth's gravity.",

However, alpha-actinin-1 and alpha-actinin-4 decreased by 40% and 30%, respectively, in the flight group (F) compared to the ground control group (G) (Fig 1).

  "conclusion": "This study demonstrates that while cytoskeletal protein levels in mouse cardiac and lung tissues remain relatively stable during long-duration spaceflight, significant changes occur in mRNA content, indicating altered translation efficiency and gene expression potentially due to increased genome methylation. The decreased mRNA content of cytosine demethylase Tet2 may contribute to the observed changes in methylation levels.",

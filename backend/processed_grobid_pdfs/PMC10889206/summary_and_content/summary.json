    "summary": "Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) serves as a dynamic energy reserve, potentially minimizing energy requirements for hematopoiesis. While BMAT can be labile, it paradoxically increases during energy deprivation, suggesting a non-traditional energy reservoir role. The study investigates whether BMAT is essential for immune reconstitution post-injury. Prior research suggests increased BMAT during fasting is an adaptive response to negative energy balance, reducing hematopoietic compartment size to lower energy expenditure. Mesenchymal cells, including adipocytes, often express stem cell factor (kit ligand), crucial for hematopoietic cell differentiation and survival.",

      "summary": "Immune cell reconstitution was assessed via adoptive transfer of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into irradiated wild-type (WT) and BMAT-deficient mice. Flow cytometry analysis revealed substantial reconstitution of B and T cell compartments with donor-derived GFP+ immune cells in both groups, observed in blood at 4 and 9 weeks, and in bone marrow and lymph nodes post-necropsy. The magnitude of hematopoietic cell reconstitution did not significantly differ between WT and BMAT-deficient mice. Figure 4 illustrates the percentages of GFP+ cells in mesenteric lymph nodes, peripheral blood, and bone marrow, demonstrating effective immune reconstitution in both groups.",

No significant differences were found in terminal body, spleen, or adrenal weights, nor in blood glucose levels, 11 weeks post-irradiation/adoptive transfer. However, abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) and seminal vesicle weights were lower in BMAT-deficient mice compared to WT mice, suggesting some impact on peripheral fat depots.",

No significant differences were observed between WT and BMAT-deficient mice in humerus length, total humerus bone volume, or cortical and cancellous bone architecture. Trabecular thickness in the lumbar vertebra was an exception, being lower in BMAT-deficient mice. Femur bone area, bone mineral content (BMC), and bone mineral density (BMD) also showed no significant differences.

BMAT was abundant in WT mice but nearly absent in BMAT-deficient mice. Adipocyte area/tissue area and adipocyte density were significantly lower in BMAT-deficient mice, although the size of the few remaining adipocytes did not differ from those in WT mice. Figure 6 shows representative histological images highlighting the differences in BMAT.",

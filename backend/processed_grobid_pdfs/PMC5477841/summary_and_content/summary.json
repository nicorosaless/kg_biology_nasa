    "summary": "This study investigates the impact of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs, aiming to understand the increased risk of intervertebral disc herniation in astronauts after spaceflight. The research quantifies the bending properties of tail discs from mice exposed to microgravity during a 30-day space mission, comparing them with control mice. The study employs four-point bending tests, histology, and micro-computed tomography (μCT) to analyze spinal segments.",

Bone volume fraction (BV/TV), bone mineral density (BMD), and trabecular parameters were measured in a trabecular volume of interest (VOI) near the growth plate (Fig. 5). This VOI was selected to analyze changes in trabecular bone density influenced by spaceflight. Parameters were also measured for the entire vertebrae.",

Disc height was significantly reduced in flight mice. The maximum load reached during preconditioning was significantly increased in flight mice. The failure modes observed varied between the groups, with controls failing at the disc-vertebra junction, and flight samples failing within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone.",

Specifically, bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness were reduced. Regression analyses showed relationships between bending properties and bone quality, such as increased displacement at failure with higher BV/TV and BMD (Fig. 10). Analysis of entire vertebrae indicated a significant decrease in trabecular thickness (Fig. 11A), and toe region displacement increased with trabecular thickness (Fig. 11B).",

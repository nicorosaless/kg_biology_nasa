    "summary": "The paper reviews published human alleles with protective effects against cancer and promoting bone, muscle, and cardiovascular health, relevant to aerospace medicine. Omics technologies are being used to develop health recommendations, but these alleles have not been systematically characterized for spaceflight. Deep space exploration broadens human diversity in space, necessitating precision healthcare and countermeasures, with omics potentially improving health maintenance in space. The study considers challenges and ethics of researching protective mechanisms for space crew health during extended missions.",

      "summary": "Spaceflight induces physiological stress, affecting musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and other systems, increasing cancer, diabetes, and aging risks. Known alleles impacting radiation tolerance, bone density, and immune function may benefit from precision countermeasures, though adaptation has limits. Omics aids understanding of risks to improve traditional protective measures. Aerospace healthcare programs should integrate omics data. Figure 2 illustrates spaceflight health risks, countermeasures, and benefiting terrestrial populations; examples include musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes, sleep, and vision-related risks.",

      "summary": "Radiation exposure poses in-flight (acute radiation sickness) and long-term (cancer) health hazards during deep space missions. ISS astronauts receive lower radiation doses due to Earth's magnetosphere, unlike deep space missions. A 500-day Mars mission could expose astronauts to career radiation limits, increasing cancer risk. Models suggest higher cancer risks from Mars missions than previously estimated. Other celestial bodies pose even greater dangers.",

      "summary": "LEO studies show monthly bone mineral density (BMD) loss of 1-1.5% in weight-bearing bones. Six-month ISS missions cause bone loss equivalent to two decades of aging. Models predict 32.4-36.8% BMD loss during Mars missions, leading to osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fracture risks. Deep space radiation exacerbates BMD loss. Recovered bone after spaceflight resembles that of older individuals. Upcoming missions lasting over a year intensify concerns.",

Families revealed genes for stronger bones (LRP5) and higher oxygen transport (EPOR). Isolated populations showed alleles linked to alleviated atherosclerosis and cancer. Populations adapted to extreme environments offer insights into altered gas composition tolerance. These findings inform potential spaceflight countermeasures.",

Genetic variants modify responses to nutrients like vitamins and fats, influencing immunity, organ health, endurance, and skills. Omics can inform nutrition during space exploration, exemplified by spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) linked to vitamin B levels and one-carbon metabolism genes. Dietary interventions related to alleles could counteract space-induced inflammation, such as plant polyphenols activating SIRT1.",

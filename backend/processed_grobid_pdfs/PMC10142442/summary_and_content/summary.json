Current treatments face challenges due to increasing drug resistance, highlighting the need for new anti-HCMV drugs with novel mechanisms. This study investigates a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber *Pentacta pygmaea* (PpFucCS) targeting heparan sulfate (HS)-virus interactions to block HCMV entry into cells.",

Native PpFucCS exhibited potent inhibitory activity, while the fractions showed decreased activity. At 50 µg/mL, the efficacy of native PpFucCS, hydrolyzed PpFucCS (HdPpFucCS), and Fr1 were comparable to unfractionated heparin (UFH). Native PpFucCS had the lowest IC50 value. Fractions 1-3 had similar structures, whereas fraction 4 showed signs of desulfation. Figure 2 shows anti-HCMV activity of PpFucCS oligosaccharides.",

The R18 fluorescence increases upon fusion with the host cell membrane. Significantly fewer virus particles entered PpFucCS-treated cells compared to mock-treated cells at 60 minutes post-infection, demonstrating that PpFucCS inhibits HCMV entry.

Fractions 3 and 4, which showed little antiviral activity, also did not protect against cell death. Native PpFucCS at 500 µg/mL showed no cytotoxic effect. ATP release assays corroborated these findings. Figure 4 shows the effect of PpFucCS and its oligosaccharides on cell viability.",

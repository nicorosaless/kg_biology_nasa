Optimization of filtration conditions.Exposing the G1 embryos (and a few larvae) recovered from the 20 Î¼M filter to 25% bleach solution for 30 seconds killed the larvae and had a minimal effect on the embryos as measured by determining the embryonic lethality after 24 hours.Data were collected from one replicate for conditions 1 to 5. Because alive larvae were observed for the first four conditions and the percent embryonic lethality was greater than 50% for the fifth condition, additional replicates were not performed.Data were collected from five replicates for the sixth and seventh conditions.",

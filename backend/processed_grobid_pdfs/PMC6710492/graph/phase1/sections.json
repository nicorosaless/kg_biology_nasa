    "text": "With the advent of genetically modified crops and the introduction of no-till methods, herbicides have become the \"stars\" of the chemicals used in industrial agriculture.Currently, glyphosate-based herbicides, whose main mode of action is through the disruption of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis (Amrhein et al., 1980), are used worldwide, while other herbicides are applied as complementary tools for weed control.Herbicides have several different modes of action (Peterson et al., 2015).Auxinic herbicides, which belong to a chemical family largely used in agriculture, mimic the biphasic effects of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which is the principal natural auxin in higher plants.It usually stimulates growth by cell division and elongation when targeted to cell sites of action at low concentration (Grossmann, 2010).Auxin-derived herbicides such as phenoxy hormone products were used in an average of 22,916 tons worldwide between 1990-2002.The use of these herbicides was reported to increase an average of 30,436 tons of active ingredients between 2003-2014(FAOSTAT, 2018)).After more than 2 decades of glyphosate massive spraying in Argentina, the use of herbicides such as 2, 4-D, paraquat and dicamba has sky-rocketed in the last years to prevent the spread of glyphosate resistance in target weeds.The 2,4-D was the third most imported herbicide into Argentina between 2013and 2015(SENASA, 2018)), and now it is considered one of the most used agrochemicals worldwide (Singh and Singh, 2016).Moreover, plants genetically modified to tolerate different herbicides, including 2,4-D, were recently approved for commercial production in Argentina (CONABIA, 2019).Under this scenario, 2,4-D application rates are expected to increase in Argentina.\nThe 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) is an auxin-type selective herbicide that induces overgrowth of vascular cambium in dicotyledonous, ultimately leading to death (Song, 2014).After application, it is transformed by bacterial metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Singh and Singh, 2016).The persistence of 2,4-D in the environment depends on the availability of other carbon sources involved in microbial metabolism, its half-life being between 20 and 312 days (Islam et al., 2018).\nBuild-up of 2,4-D residues may cause important alterations in soil and aquatic ecosystems.The 2,4-D can produce disruptive effects in fungi (Bernat et al., 2018), insects (Sharma et al., 2018), amphibians (LaChapelle et al., 2007;Aronzon et al., 2011;Van Meter et al., 2018), fish (Dehnert et al., 2018;De Arcaute et al., 2018), and others (Islam et a. 2018).Other studies reported the effect of pure 2,4-D on microbial communities (Kobraei and White, 1996;Aguayo et al., 2014;Lozano et al., 2018), but little is known about the collateral impact of commercial formulations of this herbicide on wild biota in agricultural landscapes.These commercial formulations consist of the active ingredient (2,4-D), water and inert elements such as solvents, surfactants and humectants of unknown composition which increase plant cuticle permeability to 2,4-D (Lanctôt et al., 2014).\nThe 2,4-D has different effects according to its concentration: low concentrations stimulate the growth of some phytoplanktonic species, whereas high concentrations inhibit their development (Boyle, 1980;Kobraei and White, 1996;Wong, 2000).In regard to other freshwater communities, De Lipthay et al. (2003) reported that low concentrations of the active ingredient (a.i.) (<40 μg L À1 ) modify the structure of the bacterial community from a shallow aquifer, leading to an increase in 2, 4-D degrading bacteria.In addition, an increase in Actinobacteria growth was detected at 20 mg L À1 of 2,4-D in an oligotrophic lake (Aguayo et al., 2014), which resulted from the ability of Arthrobacter sp. to use 2,4-D and other aromatic compounds as sources of carbon and energy (Sandmann and Loos, 1988;Westerberg et al., 2000).\nIt is well known that freshwater systems become contaminated either by direct spraying over water or indirectly via soil drift (Ensminger et al., 2013;Aparicio et al., 2015;Berman et al., 2018;Metcalfe et al., 2019).Algae and cyanobacteria from lakes, ponds and rivers share several metabolic pathways with vascular plants, suggesting that they can be similarly affected by herbicides (Ferrari et al., 2018).Indeed, these organisms have shown to be severely altered, mainly at the population level (Vera et al., 2010(Vera et al., , 2012;;Lipok et al., 2010;P erez et al., 2011;Qiu et al., 2013;Pizarro et al., 2016).They are important in freshwater ecosystems because of their role as main primary producers, either as free-living planktonic organisms or attached to diverse substrata (phyto-periphyton fraction).Taking into account the important ecosystem services supplied by freshwater systems, there is increasing concern about the deleterious effect of herbicides, as previously demonstrated for glyphosate (P erez et al., 2007).\nThere are more than 10,000 shallow lakes in the Pampa plain of Argentina (Dukatz et al., 2006), which is one of the most affected regions by agricultural activities worldwide.These water bodies switch between two alternative stable states with contrasting typologies (Scheffer et al., 1993): clear-water lakes with very low phytoplankton abundance and turbid ones dominated by phytoplankton.Both states show different phytoplankton populations, as they are adapted to distinct nutrient and light conditions (Allende et al., 2009).In last decades, however, there are some evidences indicating that lakes remain turbid due to agrochemical contamination (Quir os et al., 2002;Vera et al., 2010).\nIn this work we evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50 ® , a commercial formulation of 2,4-D, on the structure of freshwater microbial communities under different exposure conditions using microcosms.The assays were carried out with two different consolidated microbial assemblages.One of these was sampled from a clear freshwater system and the other from a turbid freshwater system.We analyzed the quali-and quantitative composition of micro þ nano phytoplankton (>2 μm) and photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2-2 μm), which includes prokaryotic phycocyaninrich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk).Bacterioplankton (HB, heterotrophic bacteria) was also considered in the analysis}.All the microbial communities were exposed to a wide range of concentrations of the active ingredient for 7 d.We tested the following hypotheses: 1the impact of AsiMax 50 ® depends on water turbidity, which results from the different structure of the microbial communities; and 2-the impact of AsiMax 50 ® depends on the 2,4-D concentration used.",

treated with 2,000 mg L À1 (RM-ANOVA, p ¼ 0.580), while this population showed a significant growth response in the rest of the treatments, including controls.Such growth inhibition at 2,000 mg  L À1 led to a significant decrease in PEuk abundance of ~18 times at Tf, compared to control (ANOVA, p˂0.001) (Fig. 6A).In the turbid system at T1, PEuk abundance ranged from 6,621 AE 368 ind mL À1 (0.02 mg L À1 ) to 39,887 AE 11,842 ind mL À1 (2,000 mg L À1 ).At this time, a significant increment of ~5 times compared to control was measured in the 2,000 mg L À1 treatment (ANOVA, p˂0.001) (Fig. 6B).At Tf, the abundance of this fraction ranged from 2,950 AE 223 (20 mg L À1 ) to 10,979 AE 4,271 (2,000 mg L À1 ), with no significant differences between treatments and control.The abundance of this population decreased significantly between T1 and Tf for the 200 and 2,000 mg L À1 treatments (RM-ANOVA, p ¼ 0.026 and p<0.001 respectively), resulting from an early growth and a subsequent decrease.In the clear system, PC-Pcy abundance ranged from a minimum mean (AESD) value of 166 AE 29 (200 mg L À1 ) to a maximum of 282 AE 87 ind mL À1 (20 mg L À1 ) at T1, while it ranged from 80 AE 75 (0.02 mg L À1 ) to 286 AE 91 ind mL À1 (2,000 mg L À1 ) at Tf (Fig. 6C).In the turbid system, its  were compared by a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test.Different letters mean significant differences (p<0.05).\nabundance ranged from 80 AE 77 (0.2 mg L À1 ) to 206 AE 86 (200 mg L À1 ) at T1, and from 187 AE 90 (0.2 mg L À1 ) to 333 AE 207 ind mL À1 (0.02 mg L À1 ) at Tf (Fig. 6D).No significant effects between treatments were found in any case for this population.\nPE-Pcy, the most abundant PPP fraction, at T1 ranged from 22,969 AE 2,530 (200 mg L À1 ) to 164,130 AE 48,443 ind mL À1 (2,000 mg L À1 ) in the clear system.At this time, a significant increase in PE-Pcy abundance of ~5 times was observed in relation to control in the 2,000 mg L À1 treatment (ANOVA, p˂<0.001) (Fig. 6E).At Tf, there were no significant variations, with a minimum of 15,527 AE 8,418 (0.02 mg L À1 ) and a maximum of 23,553 AE 4,497 ind mL À1 (control).RM-ANOVA revealed an early increase (at T1) in the abundance of this fraction in the 2,000 mg L À1 treatment, with a subsequent decline at Tf (RM-ANOVA, p<0.001).In the turbid system, this fraction ranged from 62,626 AE 44,171 (0.02 mg L À1 ) to 651,631 AE 68,514 ind L À1 (2,000 mg L À1 ) at T1 and from 115,508 AE 16,676 (2 mg L À1 ) to 853,987 AE 230,227 ind L À1 (2,000 mg L À1 ) at Tf (Fig. 6F).This population showed a significant increase in abundance of ~4 times at T1, and of ~5 times at Tf in the 2,000 mg L À1 treatment compared to control (ANOVA, p0.001 in both cases).Also, an increase in abundance of ~3 times was recorded in the 200 mg L À1 treatment (ANOVA, p˂0.001) at Tf for the turbid system (Fig. 6F).These increases persisted between T1 and Tf for the 200 and 2,000 mg L À1 treatments (RM-ANOVA, p ¼ 0.004 and p ¼ 0.017, respectively).\nAt Tf, the percentage contribution of the different size autotrophic fractions to total autotrophic biomass varied among groups (Table 4).For the turbid system, micro þ nano phytoplankton showed a lower contribution in the treatments at higher concentrations (200 and 2,000 mg L À1 ) (ANOVA, p ¼ 0.005 and p<0.001, respectively).This decrease was in accordance with the increase in the percentage contribution of the PE-Pcy fraction at 200 mg L À1 (ANOVA, p ¼ 0.004), as well as with the increase in the percentage contribution of both PE-Pcy (ANOVA, p<0.001) and PEuk (ANOVA, p ¼ 0.002) fractions at 2,000 mg L À1 .\nIn general, in the turbid system there were significant correlations between chlorophyll a concentration and the percentage contribution of micro þ nano phytoplankton (r Pearson ¼ 0.66; p ¼ 0.0012), PEuk (r Pearson ¼ -0.62; p ¼ 0.0029) and PE-Pcy (r Pearson ¼ -0.66; p ¼ 0.0011).On the contrary, no correlations were found between these variables in the clear system.",

    "text": "Our results strongly suggest that the degree of water turbidity affects the response of the studied freshwater populations exposed for 7 days to the 2,4-D-based herbicide Asimax 50 ® .We found differences in the structural integrity of the phytoplankton and picoplankton communities from low to high concentrations of the active ingredient.\nThe impact of AsiMax 50 ® on micro þ nano phytoplankton seemed to be greater in the turbid than in the clear system, in terms of both richness and abundance.An experimental effect of the clear system on this fraction was likely to occur between T0 and Tf, compared to control.This was not observed in the turbid system and may be attributable to a \"confinement effect\" (Pesce et al., 2009), which takes place after samples collected from a natural system are placed into microcosms of lower volume.At T0, phytoplankton diversity, richness and evenness were higher in the clear than in the turbid system.At Tf, no decrease in phytoplankton richness was observed for any treatment in the clear system, while it decreased significantly at 200 and 2,000 mg L À1 of 2,4-D in the turbid system.This suggests that some species cannot survive at the higher herbicide concentrations, in agreement with that reported for 2, 4-D by Kobraei and White (1996).Communities with high levels of diversity tend to be more resilient to environmental changes (Oliver et al., 2015), due to redundancy among different species sharing similar functions.Resilience increases if these species also show differential resistance to a contaminant.Indeed, Girvan et al. (2005) have demonstrated that bacterial diversity in soils promotes community stability and resilience after benzene perturbation.In the case of phytoplankton, it is expected that the differential sensitivity of species to herbicides (Huertas et al., 2010) as well as their presence and relative abundance, will determine the response of the community as a whole.The richer the community, the greater the chance for the presence of tolerant or resistant species to a contaminant, and the response of the community will rely upon the evenness and sensitivity of the dominant species, if any.\nIn general, natural or anthropogenic agents induce a wide range of responses in biological entities, according to their scale of complexity (Peck, 2011).For example, variations in total abundance may reflect different physiological strategies.In our study, phytoplanktonic species that survived at 2,000 mg L À1 of 2,4-D in the clear system and at 200 and 2,000 mg L À1 of 2,4-D in the turbid system showed low abundance values due to decreased reproduction.A similar behavior was observed for phytoplankton exposed to the commercial glyphosate-based formulation RoundUp ® , which had no effect on species richness but produced a significant strong decrease in total abundance (P erez et al., 2007).\nThe abundance of the micro þ nano phytoplankton community decreased at higher concentrations and increased at lower concentrations of 2,4-D (0.02; 0.2; 2 and 20 mg L À1 ), with a humped-shaped, dosedependent response.This effect was more clearly noted in the turbid than in the clear system.Although we used a commercial formulation with undeclared ingredients to obtain a more realistic approach, stimulation effects on phytoplankton are consistent with those previously reported for the active principle.In this regard, further experiments comparing the effects of pure 2,4-D and AsiMax ® are required for a more conclusive assessment.Nevertheless, the stimulation of phytoplankton at low doses of 2,4-D has been already reported in studies involving algal monoculture trials and mesocosms (Boyle, 1980;Kobraei and White, 1996;Wong, 2000).The auxin pathways and their modes of action are well-known for vascular plants, but not for algae ( Zi zkov a et al., 2016) and after many years of debate (Lau et al., 2009), the presence of auxin pathways in algae and cyanobacteria was finally confirmed by Sergeeva et al. (2002).Certainly, the fact that 2,4-D induces growth at low doses and causes growth inhibition at higher ones provides evidence that it may mimic hormonal function.\nMoreover, the presence or absence of auxin pathways in the different species (e.g.Staurastrum sp., dominant in the turbid system) occurring in each community, could be determinant for the whole community response.\nZi zkov a et al. (2016) demonstrated that some cyanobacteria and algae that differ taxonomically possess different concentrations of IAA.They found that four species of Chlamydomonales have low IAA concentration, while some Desmidiales, the same group as that of Staurastrum sp., have high IAA concentration.Different sensitivity was observed for Chlamydomonas sp. and Ochromonas sp. that were present in both kinds of systems.These species tended to decrease in abundance with respect to control in the clear system while they tended to increase in the turbid one.The impact of 2,4-D on the community may not only be direct, according to species sensitivity but also indirect, via the interactions among community members.The differential absorption and/or utilization of the 2,4-D by certain species may indirectly affect the total abundance of others.In our case, it is possible that the intake of 2, 4-D by the dominant Staurastrum sp.limited the exposure of other species to the herbicide.In addition, the 2,4-D may indirectly affect the freshwater community through ecological interactions such as competition, facilitation and/or predation.Numerous examples of these indirect effects due to different contaminants can be found in the comprehensive review by Fleeger et al. (2003).In our study, the sensitivity of Chlamydomonas sp. to 2,4-D detected in the clear system was probably masked in the turbid one by Staurastrum sp.growth.A similar process would have occurred for Ochromonas sp.The correlation network analyses suggest that the 2,4-D stimulated the growth of Staurastrum sp. when it was predominant through a putative auxin pathway, and that this allowed the development of other species that are actually sensitive to 2,4-D.In brief, the capacity of Staurastrum sp. to rapidly absorb the contaminant may have decreased the exposure of other species in the turbid system.The fact that Staurastrum sp.occurred in the clear system but in a very low proportion may indicate that not only species composition but also their relative abundance are important to predict the behavior of the system in response to a contaminant.The comparison of the correlation networks indicated that species were less intercorrelated in the clear system than in the turbid one, suggesting greater community stability for the former than for the latter under herbicide stress.In a less stable community, the change in one species affects the other species.The difficulty of determining the processes that control the responses of a given species strongly underlines the need to be cautious when extrapolating results from monospecific assays to realistic field situations.Lozano et al. (2018), who performed a microcosm experiment with the same Staurastrum sp. as used here but collected from a phytoplanktonic community with different structural characteristics, reported that it always decreased in abundance after exposure at different concentrations of 2,4-D in pure form.This suggests that the same species may respond differently to agrochemicals depending, on one hand, on the characteristics of their phytoplankton community and, on the other hand, on the form of the chemical assayed (i.e.pure versus formulation).AsiMax 50 ® is a commercial formulation based on 2,4-D as active ingredient, with coadjuvants and other substances.The use of active ingredient and/or commercial formulations makes the comparison across assays difficult.The impacts of active ingredients and commercial formulations on freshwater organisms and/or communities have been well documented for different herbicides (Tsui and Chu, 2003;Annett et al., 2014;Lipok et al., 2010;De Stefano et al., 2018).\nThe significant increase in the abundance of HB was only observed at the highest 2,4-D concentration in the clear system, probably because the herbicide acted as a nutrient source for bacterial growth.On the other hand, the HB did not show a significant growth in the turbid system probably because its initial abundance was sufficient to metabolize the herbicide.Pizarro et al. (2016) studied the impact of glyphosate formulation Glifosato Atanor ® on microbial communities from clear and organic turbid freshwater systems.In agreement with our study, they found that abundance of bacteria only increased in clear water, most likely because the herbicide was used as nutrient source.The effect of 2, 4-D on bacterial communities has been studied by Aguayo et al. (2014), who observed that the phylum Actinobacteria was predominant at 20 mg L À1 of 2,4-D, using water from a cold and pristine oligotrophic lake.Likewise, De Lipthay et al. (2003) reported that a long-term exposure of a subsurface aquifer to a mixture of auxinic herbicides at low concentrations (<40 μg L À1 ) induced the increment of phenoxy acid-degrading bacteria.\nThe PPP fraction also seemed to experience more pronounced changes in the turbid than in the clear system.It showed a rapid response after 15 min at the highest herbicide concentration in both clear and turbid systems, which was determined by the different behavior of their respective components.This effect was due to a rapid increase in the abundance of PE-Pcy in the clear system and of PEuk and PE-Pcy in the turbid one.The PPP fraction also showed an increase in abundance at the higher herbicide concentrations at Tf in the turbid system.This was mediated by an increase in the PE-Pcy fraction, which was probably stimulated by the combination of direct and indirect effects of AsiMax 50 ® .The herbicide would act directly on the PE-Pcy fraction if it had auxin pathways, and in this regard Zi zkov a et al. (2016) found that two species of cyanobacteria (Chroococcus minutus and Phormidium animale) contained very high amounts of endogenous auxin (IAA).On the other hand, the decrease in the micro þ nano plankton in the same treatments could have indirectly stimulated the growth of PE-Pcy due to decreased competitive pressure.\nChanges in micro þ nano phytoplankton and PPP abundance accounted for changes in chlorophyll a concentration; this is particularly true for the former fraction, which represented more than 99% of the total phytoplanktonic biomass.This phenomenon was more clearly observed in the turbid system, where chlorophyll a concentration followed a similar hump-shaped, dose-dependence pattern as that obtained for micro þ nano phytoplankton abundance.Changes in turbidity resembled those in chlorophyll a concentration, especially for the turbid system, where both variables decreased to lower levels.\nThe Pampa Plain in Argentina has plenty of permanent shallow lakes with contrasting water turbidity and phytoplankton biomass.It is one of the principal agricultural regions worldwide, where millions of liters of agrochemicals are used each year.The present investigation provides new evidence on the mode of action of the 2,4-D-based herbicide Asimax 50 ® in freshwater, which is one of the most frequently used commercial formulations in agricultural fields of Argentina.The observed variations in the essential constituents of microbial food chains can produce major functional changes, which are mainly concerned with carbon fluxes affecting the whole dynamics of a freshwater ecosystem.National regulatory agencies establish environmentally safe concentrations of agrochemicals mainly based on results from monoculture experiments.However, this study provides evidence that such concentrations can be unrealistic because species exhibit different behavior when growing in a community.Despite the limitations of the experimental system, our results highlight the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict the sense, magnitude and direction of changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to 2,4-D formulations.",

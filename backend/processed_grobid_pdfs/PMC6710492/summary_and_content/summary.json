Microcosms were exposed to seven concentrations of 2,4-D (0-2000 mg a.i. L À1) for 7 days. Physical/chemical parameters (turbidity, 2,4-D concentration), chlorophyll a levels, and biological variables (phytoplankton, PPP, HB) were measured. Phytoplankton was identified using Utermöhl's technique. PPP and HB populations were analyzed via flow cytometry. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, Tukey tests, and network analysis to assess treatment effects.",

At the end of the experiment, turbidity significantly decreased in the turbid system at higher 2,4-D concentrations (20-2000 mg L À1) compared to the control (Fig. 1A).",

The turbid system also showed a significant increase in Chlorophyta at Tf (Fig. 2B). Species richness decreased at higher herbicide concentrations in the turbid system.

The herbicide's impact on micro/nano phytoplankton was greater in the turbid system. Higher diversity in the clear system might explain its resilience. The study highlights the importance of community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological assessments. The total abundance of living micro + nano phytoplankton increased at lower concentrations in the turbid system, fitting a humped-shaped curve.",

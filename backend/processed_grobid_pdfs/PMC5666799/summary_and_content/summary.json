This study investigates the impact of low-LET protons and high-LET 56Fe ions on bone remodeling, osteoblastogenesis, and redox-related gene expression in mice, simulating space radiation exposure. The study hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes.",

Shipment of mice caused a 5% decline in body weights across all groups. By euthanasia, body mass did not significantly differ between irradiated and control groups. Coat color, another health index, was assessed at one year. Sham controls showed minimal coat color change, while 56Fe (200 cGy) caused a gray coat in all mice, suggesting a dose-dependent effect on general health.",

Aging caused a 54% reduction in bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) in sham-treated animals between 5 weeks and 1 year. At 5 weeks, 56Fe (50 and 200 cGy) caused decrements in BV/TV and strut number (Tb.N). Protons (200 cGy) also decreased BV/TV and Tb.N, with trends at 50 cGy. At 1 year, 56Fe (200 cGy) showed a trend of decreased BV/TV and Tb.N. Lower radiation doses did not show detectable bone loss.",

Lower doses did not affect mineralized area. Radiation exposure did not modify expression levels for most genes analyzed during the mineralization phase.

      "summary": "In vitro experiments examined the impact of radiation on osteoprogenitors, comparing low-LET (137Cs) and high-LET (56Fe) species. Significant growth decrements were observed after exposure to 137Cs (200 cGy and 500 cGy) or 56Fe (100 cGy, 200 cGy). Osteoprogenitors appeared more sensitive to high-LET 56Fe than low-LET 137Cs. Exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected cell growth from 137Cs irradiation, indicating the role of oxidative stress.",

  "conclusion": "Low doses of protons or 56Fe had no significant adverse effects on bone structure or osteoblastogenesis. A high dose of 56Fe radiation (200 cGy) induced detrimental effects on antioxidant capacity, bone structure, and osteoprogenitor populations. High-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated redox-related gene expression, potentially contributing to bone loss. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the long-term effects of space radiation on skeletal health and the potential benefits of antioxidant interventions.",

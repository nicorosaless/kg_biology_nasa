    "summary": "Skeletal muscle atrophy during disuse is driven by imbalances in protein synthesis and degradation, but the underlying triggers remain unclear. While oxidative stress has been challenged as a primary trigger, mitochondrial dysfunction is emerging as a potential causative factor. Mitochondrial fusion and fission, regulated by PGC-1α, are critical for mitochondrial function. This study investigates whether mitochondrial dysfunction triggers disuse-induced muscle atrophy in the fast gastrocnemius muscle, focusing on the role of mitochondrial fusion proteins and AMPK activation.",

This study supports the idea that a metabolic program plays a major role, but through different pathways in slow (soleus) and fast (gastrocnemius) muscles. In soleus, atrophy is driven by a fall in PGC-1α expression, leading to atrogene induction via FoxO3 disinhibition. In gastrocnemius, the primary event is the downregulation of pro-fusion proteins, causing energy stress and atrogene induction through AMPK activation. The higher efficacy of resistance training could be due to the maintenance of PGC-1alpha levels."

PGC-1α levels higher than basal are necessary to increase pro-fusion proteins, thus preventing gastrocnemius muscle atrophy during disuse.",

    "summary": "The study investigates the effects of simulated microgravity on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) using clinorotation, a ground-based technique that simulates weightlessness. Understanding the biological mechanisms of gravity's role in human health is crucial for long-term space exploration. Previous research has highlighted the adverse effects of space travel, such as bone loss and muscle tissue degeneration. This study focuses on hMSCs due to their involvement in musculoskeletal functions and bone repair. Clinostats offer a cost-effective alternative to space-based research, allowing for controlled microgravity simulation.",

The setup included an Olympus IX-81 epi-fluorescence microscope for visualization. A clinochip device was used to visualize cell spreading, consisting of polydimethylsiloxane sandwiched between glass layers with channels for cell seeding. Cell migration was analyzed using Ibidi Chemotaxis slides, with cells constrained to minimize centrifugal effects. Nerve growth factor (NGF) was used to create a chemical gradient to study hMSC chemotaxis.",

Rotation paused hourly for bright-field imaging. Post-experiment, cells were fixed, stained for actin and vinculin, and images were analyzed using ImageJ.",

Clinorotated cells exhibited impeded spreading almost immediately, with higher angular frequencies causing greater inhibition. After 8 hours, cells at 30 rpm had an average area of 2750 μm², while cells at 60 and 75 rpm had significantly smaller areas.

  "conclusion": "The study demonstrates that hMSCs respond to clinorotation by adopting more rounded morphologies, with the angular frequency influencing the rate of perturbation. Higher clinorotation speeds resulted in greater inhibition of cell spreading. Clinorotation also compromised cell motility, with most cells exhibiting retraction. These findings suggest that a cell's ability to sense the changing gravity vector depends on the rate of perturbation, which has implications for understanding cellular behavior in microgravity environments.",

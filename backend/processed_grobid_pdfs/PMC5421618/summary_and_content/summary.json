    "summary": "The study investigates the impact of housing temperature on bone physiology in female mice, a common preclinical model for osteoporosis. Unlike humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss during growth, particularly in the C57BL/6J (B6) strain. The study addresses whether housing mice at a thermoneutral temperature (32°C), compared to standard room temperature (22°C), alters bone growth, turnover, and microarchitecture in B6 and C3H/HeJ (C3H) mice. The research aims to assess the validity of mice as preclinical models, considering the differences in thermoregulation between mice and humans.",

Experiment 2 verified the reproducibility of results and extended the study to C3H mice, with a 4-week extension to ensure peak bone mass was reached.",

      "summary": "B6 mice housed at 22°C showed gains in femur length and cortical thickness but experienced cancellous bone loss in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis due to reduced trabecular number (Figure 1). Thermoneutral housing (32°C) prevented cancellous bone loss and increased cancellous bone volume fraction in the epiphysis. Thermoneutral housing reduced food intake but increased body fat percentage and abdominal white adipose tissue weight (Figure 2). C3H mice showed similar skeletal responses to temperature as B6 mice (Figure 3). Thermoneutral housing increased bone formation indices and decreased bone resorption markers (Figure 4).",

  "conclusion": "Housing female mice at thermoneutral temperatures mitigates premature cancellous bone loss, suggesting that standard room temperature housing exaggerates physiological differences between mice and humans. This finding has implications for the validity of using mice as preclinical models for age-related bone loss, highlighting the importance of considering environmental factors in skeletal research. The study suggests that adjusting housing temperature could improve the relevance of mouse models for studying human bone diseases.",

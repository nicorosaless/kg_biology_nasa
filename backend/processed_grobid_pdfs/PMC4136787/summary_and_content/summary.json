  "intro": "The paper provides an overview of the scientific goals, experimental design, and mouse training/selection program for the Russian Bion-M 1 biosatellite mission, which resumed biomedical research in space after a 16-year hiatus. The mission aimed to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term microgravity exposure using male C57/BL6 mice. The study combined in vivo and in vitro measurements to assess the effects of spaceflight and readaptation to Earth's gravity. Ethical approval was obtained for the animal experiments.",

      "summary": "The Bion-M 1 project sought data on adaptation mechanisms of various physiological systems to microgravity and post-flight recovery. It combined in vivo functional measurements with in vitro morphological, biochemical, cellular, and molecular studies.  The study monitored re-adaptation to normal gravity and assessed post-flight in vivo functions in mice, including video recording of behavior and continuous arterial pressure recording during flight. Post-flight assessments included behavior, memory, vestibular function, physical activity, cardiovascular parameters, and home cage monitoring using an automated data collection system and telemetry.",

Specific pathogen-free mice were used to reduce variability and account for increased virulence of microorganisms in space.  A total of 45 mice per group were used in four experimental groups: space flight (SF), ground control (GC), space flight vivarium control (SFV), and ground control vivarium (GCV).  The SF group was exposed to microgravity for 30 days.  The GC experiment replicated flight conditions in a climatic chamber after the landing.  Vivarium control groups accounted for seasonal differences. Each group included mice for in vivo studies/recovery and mice for dissection/in vitro measurements. In vivo subgroups included mice with telemetry probes for blood pressure monitoring and intact animals.  Training was administered before flight and ground control experiments.",

  "conclusion": "The Bion-M 1 flight was a unique automated mission with living animals, using male mice, which required careful group selection for social housing. The training program aimed to ensure mice adaptation to stressful spaceflight conditions, collect baseline data, select homogenous groups, and promote collection of less variable data. Group-housed male mice can be successfully employed in space biomedical research following procedures outlined in this study. Failures were related to hardware malfunction and microgravity-related changes in mouse behavior. Moving parts within the habitat present potential risks. The experiment introduced implantable telemetry in small laboratory animals.",

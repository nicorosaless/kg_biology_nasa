    "summary": "Exploration missions pose environmental challenges to astronauts, including gravitational changes and radiation, impacting the CNS. The CNS is vulnerable due to its lipid concentration and energy demands, leading to behavioral deficits. Studying these effects in humans is limited, necessitating animal models like fruit flies to understand the molecular mechanisms. This study uses Drosophila to investigate the impact of microgravity (μg) and simulated Earth gravity (1g) on the fly CNS during spaceflight.",

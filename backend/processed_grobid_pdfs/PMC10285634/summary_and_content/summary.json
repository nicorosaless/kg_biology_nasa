The system is designed for assessing bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), and body composition in small animals. It elucidates the types of species that can be imaged, the duration of scans, and the principles behind dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).",

      "summary": "DXA utilizes two X-ray beams of different energies to assess body composition. The differential attenuation of these beams through tissues allows the system to determine bone and soft tissue amounts. Equations based on mass attenuation coefficients are used to measure tissue composition, enabling the distinction between fat and lean mass, as well as BMD and BMC. Calibration with phantoms of known composition is essential for accurate tissue type identification.",

      "summary": "The iNSiGHT system generates standard X-ray attenuated images, BMD images, and colorimetric lean versus fat mass images. Users can obtain measurements of lean mass, fat mass, total weight, BMD, and BMC, calculated for the whole body or specific regions of interest (ROIs). The system also allows for linear measurements and exclusion ROIs to refine data analysis. The zoom function enhances ROI precision, while exclusion ROIs remove unwanted areas from calculations.",

It includes ports for anesthesia and gas exhaust recovery, with options for blocking these ports. An automatic mask function and exclusion ROIs facilitate the removal of nose cone influence on measurements. Daily calibration tests ensure system accuracy using a dedicated phantom designed to measure total weight, fat versus lean mass, BMC, and BMD.",

Images are initially saved in a proprietary format but can be exported as JPG, TIFF, or BMP files. The system's resolution is 100 µm at the lowest stage, with a potential 30 µm resolution at 4X zoom for digital radioautography (DR) mode. The radiation dose per DXA scan is 0.66 mGy, optimized for longitudinal studies. The system exhibits high accuracy, with CV data <1% and R2 values >0.90.",

It accommodates animals from 10 to 700 g, with a scan area of 25.5 cm x 16.5 cm. Users can save images from multiple time points under a single animal file and plot measurement trends over time. Offline software analysis is available, and user profiles are password-protected. Data can be exported in .csv format for third-party software analysis.",
